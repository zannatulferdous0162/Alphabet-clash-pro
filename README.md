Alpha Clash Pro DOM is an interactive web application where I explored the intricacies of the Document Object Model (DOM) and enhanced my understanding of JavaScript. Through this project, I deepened my knowledge of DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content creation. I also learned to implement responsive designs, ensuring the application adapts well across different devices.
